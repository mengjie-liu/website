        She booked the flight back home the other day.
        <br />&emsp;It was hard to believe that two years had just flown by,
        changing everything without changing anything. She had hardly left this
        small city during that time, and the Atrium had always been a place
        close at hand, where she could come whenever she wanted. This space was
        so familiar to her, to the extent that she almost thought some parts of
        it belonged to her. However, after cleaning up her desk, the fact that
        the evidence of her existence was barely recognizable scared her. She
        realized that eventually, she would become one of the many passers-by
        who had come and gone. <br />&emsp;Quietly, she decided to leave her
        stories in this space, by presenting them in an ever-going exhibition of
        her traces.
