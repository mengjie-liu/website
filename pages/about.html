        Here is a little story about my name and my icon&ensp;:]
        <br />&emsp;“This is the third time I gave you a ride. Have a very sweet
        evening,” the Uber driver said. <br />&emsp;As I said the usual “thank
        you” and got ready to exit the car, I paused in surprise and asked why
        he remembered me. <br />&emsp;He said that my name had an interesting
        spelling and a beautiful pronunciation. <br />&emsp;“It sounds similar
        to the word meaning ‘sunflower’ in my language back home.” <br />&emsp;I
        did ask where he was from, but I don’t seem to have remembered it.
        <br />&emsp;So I opened Google translate, typed “sunflower,” went
        through all the possible equivalents in different languages that I could
        find, and let the browser pronounce each one of them.
        <br />&emsp;Nothing sounded similar. <br />&emsp;Perhaps I remembered it
        wrong, or perhaps the driver didn’t really mean “sunflower,” or perhaps
        he was just joking, but I have started to relate my name to “sunflower”
        somehow.

      <div class="aboutText">
        Mengjie is a graphic designer, web designer & developer, UI/UX designer
        (and artist?) currently based in New Haven and New York.
        <br />&emsp;She studied Japanese in college, and got her MFA degree in
        Graphic Design at Yale School of Art in 2022. <br />&emsp;During her
        study, people have described her work as “beautiful”, “full of heart”,
        “quiet but expressive”, “subtle and very precise”, “great sensitivity to
        materials & form”, “great attention to craft...” <br />&emsp;And she
        once described her work as: <br />&emsp;“It is never invasive, or angry,
        or heavy. It is like a bubble floating in the sky, like dust accumulated
        in the corner; perhaps sometimes it is more like a wisdom-tooth hole, a
        slight papercut; and sometimes it feels like a feather brushing the
        cheek, sounds like a whisper, smells like grass after the rain.”
