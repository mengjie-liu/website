        The design of the keyboard as a form of hardware has always been
        fascinating to me, given the fact that people all over the world use
        this tool to type in different languages and communicate with each
        other. Compared to writing or speaking, using the keyboard unifies the
        process and the outcome of typing. Therefore, the typed-out words seem
        to be unified – one can’t tell the accent, the voice, the pace, the
        style of the person behind these unified words. Because of this, the
        keyboard becomes a tool of erasing oneself while using the language.<br />&emsp;
        I believe that language, once used by a particular person, becomes
        personal. Thus, my idea for the “Keyboard” project is to bring back the
        erased self. I use the position of a letter on the keyboard as its x and
        y position, and I add the element of time as the z-axis to the
        coordinate system. Thus, the z position of a letter depends on the time
        interval between it and the former letter (time); the opacity of that
        letter depends on the intensity with which the key is pressed (emotion).
        All the elements create a 3D line object, like a little spirit in space.
        This project contains a self-built pressure-sensitive keyboard as the
        input hardware and an interactive online platform to generate the little
        spirits, as well as to archive them.
